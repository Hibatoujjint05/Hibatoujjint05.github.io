      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! Iâ€™m Hiba Toujjin â€” a student in Applied Computer Science who loves exploring how data and technology can make life easier and smarter.
        Iâ€™m currently learning data science, programming, and design, and I enjoy building projects that reflect both creativity and logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond coding, Iâ€™m curious about how technology connects people and ideas. I believe great design is not just about how things look,
        but how they work â€” and how they make others feel.
